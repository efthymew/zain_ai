# Assuming you have already found the XFB address, for example, 0x80000000
xfb_address = 0x80000000

# Read data from the XFB memory location
framebuffer_data = dolphin.read_bytes(xfb_address, size_of_framebuffer)

# Now you can process the framebuffer_data
# For example, you might want to save it as an image, etc.
